# Stroop_Test

The game will display one of four words: blue, black, yellow, green and red.

A random word will appear on screen, one after another, each appearing in a random color (which may not match the color denoted by the word).

The player must choose the color of the word, rather than its semantic meaning (e.g., if the word BLUE appears in red, the player should select "RED").
